/**
 * Exercise05: Mass and Weight
 * Scientists measure an object's mass in kilograms and its weight in Newtons.
 * If you know the amount of mass that an object has, you can calculate its
 * weight, in Newtons, with the following formula:
 *      Weight = Mass * 9.8
 * Write a program that asks the user to enter an object's mass, and then
 * calculates its weight. If the object weights more than 1,000 Newtons, display
 * a message indicating that it is too heavy. If the object weighs less than 10
 * Newtons, display a message indicating that the object is too light.
